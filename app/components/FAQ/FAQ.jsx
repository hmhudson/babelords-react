                Haley: Mandy and I used to frequent a venue, The Hairhole, in
                Columbia, MO when we went to Mizzou. One night we were there
                and the woman on stage called the crowd "babe lords."
                We loved that it sounded strong and feminine at the same
                time, so it stuck.
